You are an expert full-stack web developer helping me build a complete web app called **Caliph Attendance** for my Islamic school.

🎯 Goal:
Build a responsive website to track students’ attendance for daily prayers: Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha.

🕌 App Flow:
1. When the app opens, show a splash/home screen with my Caliph logo and buttons for each prayer.
2. When a user clicks a prayer (e.g. Dhuhr), show class options (like Grade 1, Grade 2, etc.).
3. After selecting a class, show a student list.
4. For each student, I can:
   - Mark ✅ Present (auto)
   - Mark ❌ Absent
   - Add ✏️ Reason manually if absent.
5. Automatically save attendance data with date and prayer.
6. Show summaries:
   - 📅 Daily summary (all classes)
   - 📆 Weekly and monthly summary
   - 👤 Individual student summary

⚙️ Tech Stack:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (clean, modern UI)
- Backend: Firebase (Realtime Database + Auth)
- Hosting: Firebase Hosting
- Design: Mobile-friendly (for teachers on phones)

💡 Notes:
- Use a green-gold color theme (Islamic elegant style)
- Use Google Fonts: “Poppins” or “Cairo”
- Make buttons big and touch-friendly
- Keep code modular and commented
- Create dummy data for students (for now)
- Firebase should store: date, prayer, class, studentName, status, reason.

🚀 Step-by-step Plan:
1. Create the HTML/CSS layout with navigation.
2. Add dummy student and class data.
3. Implement attendance marking system.
4. Connect Firebase for real data saving.
5. Build summary and reporting features.
6. Style and polish UI for a clean mobile experience.

Now start coding this project from step 1.
